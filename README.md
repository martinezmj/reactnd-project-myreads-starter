# MyReads Project

This repo fulfills the MyReads project requirements.  The main page displays three bookshelves: Currently Reading, Want to Read and Read.  Each listed book has a control to move between shelves.

There is a button on the main page to go to the Search page.  The search page is dynamic and the book state (e.g., current shelf) is maintained on this page.  The search page has a button to return to the main page.

Basic error-checking -- lack of thumbnail, lack of author, no search results -- is handled.

To install the app: `npm install`

To run the app: `npm start`
